## Introduction

<div class = "answer"> 
Fact Sheet

In this paper, the authors explore whether there exists a negative causal effect of real-world corruption scandals on trust in politicians. Additionally, they study if the impact of such scandals decays over time, and if these scandals have a weaker impact on the supporters of the party that was involved in the corruption activities.
Data: In the Barcenas case, the media released the information on scandal on 31st January 2013. The data used for conducting further analysis is from the sixth round of European Social Survey (ESS), which was conducted in Spain between 23 January, 2013 to 12 May 2013. The sample was split such that people interviewed before the uncovering of the scandal are the control group, and those interviewed after are the treatment group.
Methods: The authors use comparison in means, OLS estimation (with controls for a potential reachability bias), and additional robustness checks, such as matching and a Regression Discontinuity Design.
Results: Through the analysis, the authors found that - (a) the scandal significantly reduces the trust in politicians, (b) the effect decreases as time passes, and (c) the partisan preferences did not affect the loss of trust.

## Figure 1

<div class = "answer"> 
Figure 1 uses the Google search trends data and summarizes the relative frequencies of Google searches about the scandal. This was done to establish if the the release of documents by El Pais on 31st January can be used as an exposure variable for treatment assignment.
</div> 

```{r}

gtrends_df <- read_dta("g_trends.dta")

ggplot(gtrends_df, 
         aes(x = day, 
             y = caso_barcenas_searches)) + 
geom_line(data = gtrends_df, 
            color = "#696969", # color lines
            size = 1) +

```
<div class = "answer"> 
It is clear from the figure that the maximum peak in searches reached when El Pais leaked the documents on 31st January. The figure also shows a small peak in the searches when El Mundo released news about the scandal, but one can clearly see the searches decreasing and then reaching a maximum peak when El Pais released the news of scandal along with bookkeeping documents.

To analyze the effect of scandal on trust in politicians, the authors fitted three models with trust in politicians as the dependent variable. The trust is measured on an 11 point scale where 0 means none and 10 means absolute trust. The model1 just looks at effect of scandal on dependent variable, while model 2 and 3 also include controls for pre-treatment covariates and region fixed effects.

<div class = "answer"> 
From the regression models, we can see that the respondents interviewed after El Pais released scandal documents, displayed on an average 0.48 points lower trust in politicians than the ones that were interviewed before the scandal news aired and the difference is statistically significant. Model 2 includes pre-treatment covariates and region fixed effects and in this model, the difference between the treatment and control group's trust on average is 0.45 points, which is also larger than the difference between election winners and losers, usually deemed as a common predictor of trust in politicians.

<div class = "answer"> 
We can see from the figure that the effect of the treatment (exposure to scandal) decreases over time as we move away from the date of release of scandal. This supports author's hypothesis that the scandal influenced citizen's trust in politicians to a greater extent in the weeks right after the scandal documents were released, as compared to a later time.

## Table A9 :  RDD summary results. Dependent variable: trust in politicians.

<div class = "answer"> 
Instead of using OLS estimates to study the effect of BaÌrcenas scandal on individualsâ trust in politicians, we can produce estimates using Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD).

# Running an RDD with the forcing variable time
RD_est <- RDestimate(trstplt ~ time, data = ESS1_df, cutpoint = 0, kernel = "triangular")

# Bind DF with RDD results
RDD_df <- data.frame(1,1,1) # initialize df
RDD_df <- rbind(RDD_df, RD_est$est, RD_est$p, RD_est$se, RD_est$bw) #Pick interesting estimates

```

<div class = "answer"> 
From the above RDD model, we observe that variance is higher with smaller bandwidth, and so the estimates are only significant at p<0.1 level. For all three bandwidths, the corruption scandal had negative effect on trust in politicians. Please note that while replicating, the standard error values in our table are slightly different from the original values in paper.  
</div>

##Extension

<div class = "answer"> 
As per Tom Powell (2019), "The idea that politicians and institutions are self-interested and seek only self-profit instead of to benefit the public good is what we understand as political cynicism". When corruption scandals are exposed, people often re-engage with the feeling of distrust and cynicism towards politics and political authorities. In order to extend the analysis to see the effect of scandal on people's trust in national and international institutions, I ran regression on variables -
trstprl - trust in country's parliament, 
trstlgl - trust in legal systems, 
trstplc - trust in police, 
trstprp - trust in political parties, 
trstep - trust in european parliament, 
trstun - trust in United Nations, 
and discovered that we only get significant estimates for effect of corruption scandal on trust in police.

Covariate analysis:

To run more models on effect of corruption scandal on trust in police, we looked at the data and identified following covariates that should be controlled for:
stfdem - How satisfied you are with democracy. People more satisfied with the state of democracy are likely to be more trusting of government institutions.
aesfdrk - Feeling of safety while walking alone in local area after dark. (1 - 4 scale): Likely to be correlated to trust in police.
crmvct - Respondent or household member victim of crime. If someone is a victim of crime, they expect more protection from police.
gndr - Gender of respondent
agea - Age of respondent
eduyrs - Years of full-time education completed
ipstrgv - important that government is strong and ensures safety. (0 - 10 scale) - People who expect more safety and protection from government are more likely to relate a corruption scandal to trust in police.
tvpol - documents TV watching (news, political events, current affairs) hours. People who watch more political content on TV are more likely to form opinions on trust in institutions outside of a scandal too, these are also people who are more likely to know about the scandal also.
employment - employment type of respondent
ppltrst - How much you trust in people (0=10 scale). The tendency to trsut in people can affect how much people put trust in government institutions

Through the balance table, we can see that the groups are rather balanced. We control for the covariates in our regression models to account for their confounding effects on treatment exposure and observed outcome. 

In the next step, we run regression models with trust in police as our dependent variable and study effect of the scandal on trust in police. We also run a plm model with covariates identified in the previous steps. We also run a third model to see possible interaction effect between interest in politics and exposure to the scandal.

<div class = "answer"> 
We can see that the naive estimate of effect of scandal on trust in police is statistically significant. However, when we include covariates and region effects, the estimates are no longer significant. We can notice that some covariates such as Satisfaction with democracy, Important that government is strong and ensures safety, Victim of any crime in past, Female and Years of education have statistically significant coefficients. The standard error shot up when we include interaction effect of D with political interest, which could mean that we induced a bias with the interaction term and hence challenges my hypothesis. 
It can be concluded that there is some observed spillover effect on trust in police due to corruption scandal, but we should look at different covariates to further investigate the full effect of scandal on trust in police. We can say with some surity that corruption scadals may lead to political cynicism, but it needs to be further examined by looking at trust in various national and international institutions and using different covariates.

<div class = "answer"> 
We can observe from the graph that while there is a visible drop in trust in police immediately after the scandal, this effect decays over time and the overall average  for months before and after the scadal remain relatively similar.
